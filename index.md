# About Choreographic

Choreographic makes planning formations super easy. With smooth animations between formations and a fully customizable stage size, visualising your dance and drill choreographies has never been easier.  

P.S. Yes I know this website is super simple but I'm on a budget :') Consider subscribing to Choreographic Pro so that I can design a better website.

# Awesome Features

## Music Sync

Why should I use Choreographic when I can simply draw formations on my notebook? Well, can your notebook sync your formations with music? Probably not. (But if yes, that's one sick notebook. Consider crowdfunding it). With Music Sync, you can see precisely how your dancers transition in real-time according to the music. 

## Adjustable Transition Duration

5 6 7 8 ... 8.1, 8.2, With Choreographic, you can adjust formation and transition durations down to a tenth of a second to visualise the exact time needed for your dancers to travel.

## Customizable Stage Size

Not all stages are equal and your choreography deserves to be plotted as accurately as possible. You can change the stage width and depth and even adjust the sidestage and backstage sizes accordingly.

## Smooth Formation Transitions

Scrub between formations to experience our super smooth transitions. Help your dancers visualize exactly how they can travel without colliding with each other.

## Add Notes to Formations

We know how crazy we can get with our choreographies. But sometimes our dancers need a little help to understand our vision. Add personalized notes to each formation so that dancers can view them in context.

## Share Your Choreographies

Export any choreography within seconds. You can share your choreographies with your dancers even if they don't have access to Choreographic Pro.
